[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chapman-phys227-2016s/cw-6-YOURTEAM.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chapman-phys227-2016s/cw-6-YOURTEAM)

**Due date:** 2016/03/15

## Specification

Hint: Split into groups of 2-3 for this assignment. Implement each solution two ways: 1) numerically, using numpy as in Appendix C, and 2) symbolically using ```dsolve``` in sympy. Check that the two methods agree.

Complete the following exercises from the primary textbook, placing your solutions into separate files. In each file, write the solution as a callable function, so that you can write suitable test functions that demonstrate correct output using the nose framework. GitHub will automatically run your tests on every commit, indicating any failures via the Travis framework with build status above.

1. p.683, C.1, in ```nonhomogeneous_linear_ODE.py```
1. p.683, C.2, in ```nonlinear_ODE.py```

To cleanly present your work, create a Jupyter notebook ```cw6.ipynb``` that imports each of your python files as modules and demonstrates the functionality. The notebook should be formatted professionally using Markdown headings, including your name and a brief description of each homework section.
